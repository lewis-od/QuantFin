# Quant Fin
Python module for doing various quantitative finance things. Very much work in
progress.

Documentation is found [here](https://lewis-od.github.io/QuantFin/).

The files/notebooks in the root directory of the repository use the module to
perform some calculations and plot some nice graphs.
